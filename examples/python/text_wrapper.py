"""Wrapping, ellipsis, and a line ceiling.

Python twin of `examples/text_wrapper.rs`. None of this is arithmetic a producer can
do: where a line breaks depends on the font the host chose, so wrapping, truncation, and the
ellipsis that marks it are all the host's, asked for through a shaped paragraph.

That is the whole difference between the plain text command and a retained layout. The
plain one draws a run; this one is a paragraph with a width, a line ceiling, and an opinion
about what to do when it runs out of room.
