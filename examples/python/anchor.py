"""Panels placed against each corner of their parent.

Python twin of `examples/anchor.rs`. The toolkit spells these as an anchor plus an
offset and lets layout resolve them; a port has the parent's box in hand, so each corner is
one line of arithmetic. Painting them last is what puts them over the field they sit on —
in a display list, paint order is the whole of z-order.
