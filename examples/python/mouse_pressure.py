"""Marks as wide as the device was pressed.

Python twin of `examples/mouse_pressure.rs`. Pressure is only sent by hardware that
reports it: a host with no such device sends nothing at all rather than zero, so a mark made
by an ordinary mouse falls back to the base width instead of collapsing to nothing.

That distinction is the example. It is also why pressure arrives as its own event beside the
move rather than as a field nobody can trust.
