"""A picture that arrives, and one that never will.

Python twin of `examples/image_loading.rs`. Pixels come from somewhere else — a fetch,
a file, a side channel — so the bytes are not always what they were promised to be. A
picture that cannot be decoded leaves the box it would have been drawn in, styled and empty,
and the frame keeps the rest of its content.

The Rust original generates a PNG and hands it to the toolkit's decoder; the binding takes
raw pixels, so this port generates the checkerboard directly. And since `upload_rgba` has
no decoder to refuse them, "bytes that are not a picture" cannot exist here — the port
draws the styled empty box the Rust view's failed decode leaves behind, which is the
observable lesson either way.
