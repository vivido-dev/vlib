"""A text field: typing, selection, clipboard, and composition.

Python twin of `examples/input.rs`. Typing, selection, arrow keys, and copy/cut all
come from the protocol's own keys — the field answers HID usages, so the same code types the
same way on every host. Paste arrives as committed text through the host's own policy: a
terminal-hosted editor never reads the clipboard, it only writes one.

The caret is read off the measurement rather than counted in characters, and it is published
to the host each frame so an input method knows where to put its candidate window.
