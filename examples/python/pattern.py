"""A tiled background, next to a gradient.

Python twin of `examples/pattern.rs`. There is no hatch primitive in the protocol, so
the tile is an image uploaded once and repeated — the same appearance, through the path a
sprite or a texture atlas would use. The repeat is the brush's, not a loop: one fill command
covers the whole box however large it is.
