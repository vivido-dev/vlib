"""Alignment, weight, slant, and decorations.

Python twin of `examples/text_layout.rs`: everything here is one paragraph per block,
so the alignment is the paragraph's own — a line centered inside a box it fills, not a box
that was moved. Decorations and mixed-weight runs are shaped paragraphs, because the plain
text command carries neither underlines nor several runs.
