"""A title bar that moves the window, beside the edges that resize it.

Python twin of `examples/window_movable.rs`. Both are the same mechanism: a region's
*role* tells the host what a drag on it means — move the window, or resize it from that
edge — and the host does the work natively, without a frame in between.

An overlay window has no titlebar of its own; the terminal behind it does. So what is
movable here is the part of the pane the application nominates.
