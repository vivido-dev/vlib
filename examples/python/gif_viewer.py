"""An animation playing at its own frame rate.

Python twin of `examples/gif_viewer.rs`. Nothing here drives the animation: the frame
being shown is a function of how long the window has been up, and the view asks the loop to
wake it exactly when the next frame is due — so a held window sleeps, and a playing one
wakes as often as the animation asks for and no more.

The Rust original carries a generated GIF through a real encoder and decoder; the binding
takes raw pixels, so this port generates the same eight frames directly and uploads each
one. The lesson — a picture advancing on the window's clock — is unchanged.
