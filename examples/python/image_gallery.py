"""A grid of pictures against a bounded upload budget.

Python twin of `examples/image_gallery.rs`. The host holds a bounded number of
uploads, and a gallery is the case where that matters: scroll far enough and the pictures on
screen are not the pictures uploaded first.

The Rust toolkit has a cache that releases whatever was drawn least recently, so the view
never thinks about it. A port has no toolkit, so the example owns that policy itself — which
is the honest version of the lesson: someone has to decide what is no longer on screen, and
here it is visibly the application. Pictures are generated rather than decoded, there being
no decoder in the standard library.
