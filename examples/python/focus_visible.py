"""A focus ring that a keyboard shows and a click does not.

Python twin of `examples/focus_visible.rs`: focus that arrived from the keyboard is
drawn with a ring, focus that arrived from a click is not. That is the whole difference
between "the keyboard put it here" and "the pointer put it here", and it is why the helper
tracks the two separately.
