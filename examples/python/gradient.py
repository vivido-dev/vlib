"""Linear fills at several angles and stop sets.

Python twin of `examples/gradient.rs`. The angle convention is CSS's — 0 is upward,
90 rightward — and the helper turns it into the two endpoints the wire wants, spanning the
box along the gradient's own direction. A hard stop is two stops at the same offset.
