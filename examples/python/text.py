"""A type specimen, and the typography the wire carries.

Python twin of `examples/text.rs`. The plain text command carries a size, a weight, a
slant, a family and the two decorations — everything on the first three rows. Letter and
word spacing, a line height, and the font's own features ride `overlay-typography-v1`, and a
paragraph that asks for any of them must go through a shaped layout or the request is
silently dropped.

That distinction is invisible on screen and decides what the frame costs: a plain run is one
command, a shaped paragraph is a layout the host holds until it is replaced.
