"""A box inside a box, 64 levels deep.

Python twin of `examples/tree.rs`. The Rust original is a lesson about layout cost —
an auto-sized box asks the engine for its content size at every level, and that question
compounds — which a port sidesteps entirely: each level's box is two pixels inside its
parent's, which is arithmetic, not a solver. What survives is the display-list half of the
lesson: 64 levels is 64 fills, 64 strokes, and 64 runs of text, and that is what a frame
this deep costs.
