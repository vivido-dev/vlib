"""A log pinned to its newest line, with a scrollbar.

Python twin of `examples/list_example.rs`. Two things make a log a log rather than a
list: it follows its own tail until the reader scrolls away from it, and it takes that up
again when the reader comes back. Both are one comparison against the maximum offset.

The scrollbar is drawing, not a special case: a track, and a thumb whose length is the
fraction of the content on screen and whose position is how far through it that fraction is.
