"""A floating panel anchored to the button that opened it.

Python twin of `examples/popover.rs`: the panel paints over everything it overlaps
(late in the display list is on top), and a scrim behind it takes the clicks meant for the
rest of the window — which is how clicking outside closes it. The scrim is an ordinary
region rather than a blocking one: it has to *hear* the click that closes the panel, and a
blocking region reports nothing by design.
