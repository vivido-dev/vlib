"""Tiles dragged onto a tray, with pointer capture.

Python twin of `examples/drag_drop.rs`. A drag is three events and one piece of
state: a press records what is moving, moves carry it, and the release decides where it
landed. Capture is what makes the middle one work — without it the moves stop the moment
the pointer leaves the tile it started on, and the release is never heard at all.

Where the tray *is* comes from the frame before this one: the host hit-tested against that
frame, so it is the only geometry an event can be talking about.
