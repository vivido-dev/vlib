"""Easings, a spring, and a window that sleeps when nothing moves.

Python twin of `examples/animation.rs`. No timer runs here: every moving thing is a
function of how long the window has been up, and `request_frame_after` asks for the next
frame while there is still one worth drawing — so the loop wakes at the display's rate
while something is moving and not at all when nothing is.

(The Rust view also honours the environment's reduced-motion preference; the helper has no
environment plumbing, so this port always animates.)
