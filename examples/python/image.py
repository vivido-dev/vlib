"""One picture, fitted into its box four ways.

Python twin of `examples/image.rs`. The Rust original encodes a PNG and decodes it
again to prove the round trip; the protocol carries raw pixels either way, and neither
stdlib Python nor Node has a decoder, so this port generates the checkerboard directly as
RGBA and uploads that. The lesson is unchanged: a picture reaches the host as an upload and
a rectangle, and the fit is arithmetic the producer does.
