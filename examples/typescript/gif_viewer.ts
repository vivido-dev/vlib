// loop to wake it exactly when the next frame is due — so a held window sleeps, and a
// playing one wakes as often as the animation asks for and no more.
//
// The Rust original carries a generated GIF through a real encoder and decoder; the binding
// takes raw pixels, so this port generates the same eight frames directly and uploads each
// one. The lesson — a picture advancing on the window's clock — is unchanged.
