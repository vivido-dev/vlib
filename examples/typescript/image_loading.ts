// A picture that arrives, and one that never will.

// TypeScript twin of `examples/image_loading.rs`. Pixels come from somewhere else — a
// fetch, a file, a side channel — so the bytes are not always what they were promised to be.
// A picture that cannot be decoded leaves the box it would have been drawn in, styled and
// empty, and the frame keeps the rest of its content.
//
// The Rust original generates a PNG and hands it to the toolkit's decoder; the binding takes
// raw pixels, so this port generates the checkerboard directly. And since `uploadRgba` has
// no decoder to refuse them, "bytes that are not a picture" cannot exist here — the port
// draws the styled empty box the Rust view's failed decode leaves behind, which is the
// observable lesson either way.
