// Easings side by side, and a spring that follows clicks.
//
// TypeScript twin of `examples/animation.rs`. No timer runs here: every moving thing
// is a function of how long the window has been up, and `requestFrameAfter` asks for the
// next frame while there is still one worth drawing — so the loop wakes at the display's
// rate while something is moving and not at all when nothing is.
//
// (The Rust view also honours the environment's reduced-motion preference; the helper has
// no environment plumbing, so this port always animates.)
