"""The shared vocabulary of the vui example ports: tokens, hand-computed geometry,
the interaction state machine, and the repaint loop.

The Rust originals (``vlib/examples``) sit on a toolkit: taffy layout, an element tree,
retained images, an animation clock. Python has none of that here, and adding a framework is
not this directory's job — so every port computes its own geometry and drives the raw overlay
API through this module. What it keeps from the toolkit is the *contract*, not the machinery:

- The host does the hit testing. A frame paints hit regions; events come back naming one.
- A press is active exactly while it is held over the element it started on; a release
  anywhere ends it; a click is a release over the element the press started on.
- Nothing repaints until something asks; anything that moves is a function of the window's
  elapsed time, and a wait is a deadline the loop sleeps to — never a timer.

Colors are straight-alpha sRGB ``0xRRGGBBAA`` ints, as the binding takes them.
